## Task
  Desgin a button on a web page which redirects to an image gallery
  
## Details
  A page with a button which redirects to an image gallery (both built in AngularJs) on being clicked. The images' sources are provided by a php file running at a server which reads all the image files (.jpg, .jpeg, .png) from the "Images/" directory (relative path). Also, in this project, the image details are hardcoded for six images as no database was needed to accomplish the main task.
